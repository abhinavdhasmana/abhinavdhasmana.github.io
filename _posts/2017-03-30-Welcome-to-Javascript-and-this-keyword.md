_This is a part four of a series of blog where I am planning to capture on how we provide technical apprenticeship to new college graduates that intern with us. Here is_ [_Part 1_]({% post_url 2017-02-15-Git-101-and-its-day-to-day-usage-Part-1 %})_,_ [_Part 2_]({% post_url 2017-02-22-Git-101-and-its-day-to-day-usage-Part-2 %}),_ [_Part 3_]({% post_url 2017-03-24-Guiding-principals %})

Once we have the basic Git and our guiding principles in place, we start with actual programming. First step, install `nvm` and `node` from [here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

As mentioned before, we try to use as much open source as we can. We again turn to node school and solve these

One of the thing that we needed more depth was on `**this**` keyword. So here are some of the examples we used to learn more about it. All the examples here would be written in `strict mode`


{% gist 6dc133b9a21be48401d6e29c5b114513 %}

This one is simple. When in `strict mode` there is no global context and you get `**this**` as `**undefined**`. If we remove line 1, we would get a `window` object if you run this in browser or the `global` object if you are run this in node.

Lets enhance this example

{% gist 209fb3ce9e93e8686b008f8310a05d78 %}

If you are surprised by seeing `{}/window object`as an output, remember that there will always be one`this` object whose context is node/window.

Lets look at nested function

{% gist f93f474d3c51424e046d9f0eec99666e %}

We do not expect any change in the value of `this` as the context of `insideFunction` is `whoAmI` function.

What if we actually want to use `this` inside `whoAmI`? `apply` to rescue

{% gist 2a0737eb808be7193994d27c09b6ceb8 %}


With `apply`, the context is passed and hence we can see the output we see at line 4\. What about line 6? This is still just a function invocation and not with any object, so not a method invocation. Hence `this` is still undefined.

Lets extend this further, and lets say we want to have `insideFunction` to have access to `this` object as well. We have two option: Option 1 is to use `apply` again.

{% gist d5e19fea6b0ce5abfc9be2889d040d50 %}

Option 2 is where we add `insideFunction` to `this`

{% gist 0b18d32035e58d055caee576f5c8e79d %}

Note that in the second scenario, we have eventually added `insideFunction` to `this` which means that it is now exposed to outside world and probably defeating the purpose of creating a nested function. I just wanted to show the approach.

Lets start with more complicated examples and move from function invocation to methods invocation.

{% gist 3c27bb33a22f37c650e554482ea91527 %}

The output is a `testObj` because the function `whoamI` is called on the `testObj` at line 10\. Just to make the above point even more clear, look at the example below

{% gist 294296cad88f4381f331aefd9da40e2a %}

The value of `a` changes as we are operating on the same object.

Lets add some actual use case scenarios of node where async is more common

{% gist 4f47239c8d24631af498f3dc802c2c7d %}

If you are surprised by the result that the second log statement does not print the `testObj`, its because what gets passed to setTimeout is not the `testObj` but just the function. Later, the function is called with the context in which it is running.

How do we fix this? `bind` to the rescue.

{% gist 644c124280b846a0813878ebeb63fd22 %}

`bind` will make sure that this whenever this function is called, its called with the context passed as a parameter.

Lets look at some examples with classes

{% gist 06990da9af9607d1e76d32fe81f76564 %}

I am leaving arrow functions for another post.

Are there some important scenarios that you encounter/ stumped you on regular basis? Let me know and Iâ€™ll add it.

All the examples are in this [github repo](https://github.com/abhinavdhasmana/javacriptThisKeywordExamples).
