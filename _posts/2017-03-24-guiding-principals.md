# Guiding principals

_This is a part three of a series of blog where I am planning to capture on how we provide technical apprenticeship to new college graduates that intern with us. Here is_ [_Part 1_]({% post_url 2017-02-15-git-101-and-its-day-to-day-usage-part-1 %})_,_ [_Part 2_]({% post_url 2017-02-22-git-101-and-its-day-to-day-usage-part-2 %})

There are so many things other than one’s programming abilities that makes a great developer and a great colleague. Here are some of the things that we tell our interns to inculcate over time.

**Empathy:** A lot has been written about this [in](http://codingwithempathy.com/2016/05/03/empathy-an-essential-skill-in-software-development/) [software](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/empathy-the-key-to-a-successful-software-project) [development](https://www.infoq.com/news/2015/06/empathy-development). Heck, we need this for being a decent human being. When looking at a code or design choices that were made, always remember that you were not there and what all they had to choose from.

**You are not your code culture:** When we are starting new, we all make mistakes and learn. Here are some good blog posts we try to live by :[You are not your code](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YouAreNotYourCode.aspx), [Egoless programming](https://blog.codinghorror.com/egoless-programming-you-are-not-your-job/).

**There are no points for coming first:** Emphasis is on the doing the right code, naming conventions, exception handling, writing tests. Finishing first which misses any of the above points does more harm than good.

**Don’t worry too much about optimization:** Priority should be writing a easy to understand and maintainable code and not the best optimized code.

**Focus on Why’s and not How’s:** Technologies change fast!!. How do we keep up with it. Focus on principles and decision choices of the framework. Here is an excellent article [“How” ages faster than “Why”](https://hackernoon.com/how-ages-faster-than-why-712e25c9eb3b#.lzg6sp605)

**Debugging is harder than begging:** Debugging is twice as hard as programming. Write simple code. In case its convoluted, stick to the problem for a significant amount of time and don’t go to someone who could help you in the first opportunity you get. You would come out as a better developer before you started debugging.

While debugging, remember not to get into a rabbit hole to fix everything. Make necessary compromises.
