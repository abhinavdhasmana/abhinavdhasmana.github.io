![Time does not change anything](/images/blog/mid-year-1.jpg)

I love fixing broken things. Nothing excites me more. It can be frustating, time consuming and head scratching but its fun. Digging deep into why I love this, I realized that because I can measure the problem. An API is slow: measure it, fix it, measure it. Done. Deployment is broken: start back tracking, find the failing compnonent/process/box, fix it, deploy. Done

While discussing the above with one of the colleague, he made me realized that I do not apply the same priciple to self. I failed to answer if I am a better developer this year when compared to the previous one. Thinking more on this, I realized that the first and the key problem is `How do I measure this?` It is tough and changing/learning is not a overnight process. It takes time.

To take a stab at this problem, I have decided to document whatever I have done in the first half of 2015 and try to measure it.

1. Projects: I did fair on both the projects as they went without a hitch. I have some spare time in the second project, so I will be running the (ruby) project through various tool so that I can measure the quality of the code and improve on it. `Is there a jenkins plugin that I can use which I can run with every deployment?`

2. Mentorship: This year 13 interns joined us in January who are continuing with us now. I was assigned 3 people. I have been a friend to some people who have seeked advise and be a sudo mentor. This time it was official. I am very happy that all are doing very well. I did not realized this but being a good mentor is really really difficult. You have to understand from where they are coming, you have to put yourself in their shoes and understand them. You have understand their pace of learning and their interest. It is only then the appropriate suggestion(s) can be made. I was dumb enough not to find an awesome mentor for myself. It is one of the major factor which can affect your career and your pace of learning. If you are playing a role of a mentor, make sure you put your 100% into it specially if this is the first or second year of your mentee career.

3. Organizing Hackathon: This was my first event where I played the role of an event manager. I have been a part of few hackathons but never organized one. Overall it went down well and we had some exciting projects coming from it.

4. NodeJS learning group: A colleague of mine and I also started a Lunch and Learn session. Details [here][nodejs-blog] and [here][github-nodejs]

Lets see what I'll be able to write at the year end.
